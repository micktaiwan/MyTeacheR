MyTeacher - Ruby chess engine
=============================


The first version of MyTeacher was a chess program written in C++ based on TSCP
(Tom's simple chess program) that played on FICS and gave some chat comments
about opponents moves. I think it was appreciated by chess players on FICS
and I had fun developping it.

But my goal here is to dissec chess programming and rewrite the underlying
intelligence myself.

I don't think this new version will either be fast or strong.
But it will be fun to write the engine part!

"Just getting started with a new engine?
Congratulations!
You are in for a lot of fun,
but there is a considerable amount of work ahead of you."

Well... Let's see where this will lead me to...
